Discord bot to serve dac members based on on chain data.

This discord bot allows users to pair their eos account with their discord id via a signed message. The mapping will be stored in a mongodb. The bot also has a http interface/api which requires an apikey to authenticate. The apikey can be generated via a discord command and also will be stored in the same database.

The bot can assign roles to the discord users based on on chain data.
